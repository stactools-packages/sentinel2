# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). This project attempts to match the major and minor versions of [stactools](https://github.com/stac-utils/stactools) and increments the patch number as needed.

## [Unreleased] - TBD

### Added

- Added a `raster:bands` field to the `visual` asset (TCI).

## [0.6.3] - 2024-02-01

### Changed

- Scenes that produce a geometry that has an unreasonably large area now raise and exception
  rather than producing an item with that incorrect geometry.

## [0.6.2] - 2024-01-08

### Fixed

- ViewExtension handles NaN values for viewing_angles correctly.

## [0.6.1] - 2024-01-04

### Fixed

- if tileinfo metadata is missing tileDataGeometry field, throw a ValueError with a meaningful
  message instead of an unintentional KeyError

### Changed

- use reproject_shape instead of reproject_geom (deprecated)

## [0.6.0] - 2023-12-13

### Fixed

- Antimeridian-crossing scene bboxes

## Removed

- `create_item` method parameter `create_item` removed, as it was no longer used

## [0.5.0] - 2023-12-01

### Added

- Add `https://stac-extensions.github.io/sentinel-2/v1.0.0/schema.json` conformance class
- Add `s2:tile_id` field
- `product_metadata` asset ([#117](https://github.com/stactools-packages/sentinel2/pull/117))
- Examples ([#124](https://github.com/stactools-packages/sentinel2/pull/124))
- `cloud` and `snow` assets ([#129](https://github.com/stactools-packages/sentinel2/pull/129))
- gsd for ancillary assets (e.g., aot, wvp, etc) ([#139](https://github.com/stactools-packages/sentinel2/pull/139))
- Mean values for sensor azimuth and incidence angle in Item properties ([#137](https://github.com/stactools-packages/sentinel2/pull/141))
- Add PVI asset as "preview" for Sentinel-2 L2A ([#143](https://github.com/stactools-packages/sentinel2/pull/143))

### Fixed

- Antimeridian handling (again) ([#122](https://github.com/stactools-packages/sentinel2/pull/122))
- Populate `created` property with a valid RFC 3339 datetime ([#125](https://github.com/stactools-packages/sentinel2/pull/125))
- stactools required version should be >=0.5.2 instead of >= 0.4.8 ([#125](https://github.com/stactools-packages/sentinel2/pull/125))
- Roles fixed, 'reflectance' removed from auxiliary assets (e.g., wvp, aot)

### Changed

- The convention for naming the STAC Items has changed. ([#131](https://github.com/stactools-packages/sentinel2/pull/131)). A full explanation given in [Issue #130](https://github.com/stactools-packages/sentinel2/issues/130)
- pystac >= 1.9.0 is now required
- Names in eo:bands structure are now S2 band names, not common name ([#139](https://github.com/stactools-packages/sentinel2/pull/139))
- PVI asset role changed from "thumbnail" or "visual" to "overview" ([#143](https://github.com/stactools-packages/sentinel2/pull/143))
- Removed asset "thumbnail" pointing to preview.jpg asset, as this file frequently
  does not exit. ([#144](https://github.com/stactools-packages/sentinel2/pull/144))

### Removed

- Removes `s2:granule_id`
- Removes `s2:mgrs_tile` field, as this is covered by both the MRGS Extension and Grid Extension fields
- Drop support for Python 3.9
- raster:bands.bits_per_pixel ([#139](https://github.com/stactools-packages/sentinel2/pull/139))
- Band descriptions ([#139](https://github.com/stactools-packages/sentinel2/pull/139))
- Per asset sensor azimuth and incidence angles ([#137](https://github.com/stactools-packages/sentinel2/pull/141))
